Quickstart:

    To enter a spectrum:
        - make a new text file
        - write your upper limit for the y axis into the first line

        To enter the points:
            - one point is on one line
            - x and y koordinates are separated by a comma
            - x is first y is second
            - when entering floating pont numbers use a dot (example: 2.5)
            - the first point has to have the x value 380 and the last x value has to be 780
            - the absorption (the y) has to be measured from 0 to 2.5
                (
                    If yours is measured diffenrently use the convert.py.
                    For that enter "python convert.py [filename] (of the spectrum) [faktor] (to multiply your y so its from 0 to 2.5)"
                    (you have to be in the directory of the  convert.py and the spectrum)
                )

            it should look like this:
            faktor
            x1, y1
            x2, y2
            x3, y3
            x4, y4
            x5, y5
            x6, y6

            example
            2.5
            380.0, 1.0556
            420.0, 1.9167
            460.0, 0.2778
            640.0, 0.3333
            675.0, 1.5278
            700.0, 0.4167
            780.0, 0.2778

    after finishing:

    Run the programm by typing:
    "python (a python interpreter has to be installed) main.py [filename] (the one you just created)"
    into a terminal (you have to be in the directory of the main.py and the spectrum)
